# Keyloggers

Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.

This project records keys from the keyboard and stores it in a text file,

And that text file will be sent to a specified mail using SMTP library.
